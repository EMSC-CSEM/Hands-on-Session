# Hands-on-Session

Please get start with the document entitled Hands-On-Session.pdf.

Within the framework of the European EPOS-Seismology project, EMSC has
developed newest seismological products and services. Here it is proposed
to the users to interact, in a friendly manner, with these recent developments
through a slot of exercises. Users are guided step by steps thanks to chunks
of Python code ready to be executed. The main objective envision in this
Hands-on Session is not only to get an idea of the scientic resources made
online availabel by EMSC but also to test in more details how to compose
its own applications through dedicated use cases.
